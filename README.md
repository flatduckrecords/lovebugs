# Love Bugs

Please enjoy this silly nonsense, a celebration of the [Spectrum Computing](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/forums/) forum community's shared [love of the like button](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=88195#p88195). It was created for [CSSCGC 2022](http://crapgamescompetition2022.great-site.net/).

Note that a Kempston Mouse is <strong>required</strong>! Supported devices include the K-Mouse Turbo and DivTIESUS (these are modern mouse interfaces). Other/older interfaces may be supported but this has not been tested. (But do let me know if you try it!) Support for K-Mouse in emulators is good.

If you load the tape in real-time remember to stop the tape in between levels. Yes, it's a 48K multiloader! ðŸ¤ª Yes, it proabably will crash if things load in the wrong order! ðŸ¤©
